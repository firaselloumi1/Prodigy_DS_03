# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier | Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship

## ðŸ“‹Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict a binary outcome (e.g., whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit) based on various customer features. The project is structured to guide the user through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model using the Decision Tree algorithm.

## ðŸ“‚Repository Contents
- Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb: This notebook contains all code and explanations for the project. It includes sections for:
- Data Loading and Exploration: Reading the dataset, checking data types, and identifying any missing or duplicated values.
- Data Preprocessing: Renaming columns, handling categorical data, and preparing the dataset for training.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable using plots.
- Model Building and Evaluation: Building a Decision Tree Classifier and evaluating its performance with accuracy metrics.

## ðŸ”‘Key Insights
- Prediction Target: Insights into which customer features are most predictive of the target outcome.
- Model Performance: Evaluation of model accuracy, precision, and recall, providing an understanding of its effectiveness in predicting the target outcome.
- Visualization: Graphical representation of feature distributions and model decision boundaries, aiding in understanding the data and model performance.
